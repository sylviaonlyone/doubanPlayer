Douban FM Downlaoder

Playing source from Douban FM, also save audio streams to local files

Build the code
============
Douban player uses Phonon library to play audio, hence Qt Phonon library is requered. You will also need Phonon Backend installed. For more details about Phonon, please look here:
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/phonon-overview.html

The followings are what I have done on my Ubuntu 12.04 to setup build env:
1. install Phonon library packages includes:
   libphonon (Phonon frontend control)
   libphonon_dev (Phonon frontend control developing files)
   phonon-backend-gstreamer (Phonon gstreamer backend)
2. enable Phonon in Qt by config Qt source with:
   ./configurate -phonon -phonon_backend
